# guessing_game
 My first techDegree Project
 
 The goal of this project was to create a guessing game.
 
The role of the player is to choose a number between 1 and 10. When the player chooses the correct hidden number in the range(1-10) the player wins the round. The player can play any consecutive number of rounds, the program will keep the high score.
